Divide your weight in kilograms by meters squared. 
Next, you will need to divide your weight in kilograms
by your height in meters squared. For example, if your
weight is 75 kilograms and your height in meters
squared is 3.06, then you would divide 75 by 3.06 
for an answer of 24.5 as your BMI.

If your BMI is:

below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range
between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range
between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range
between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range
